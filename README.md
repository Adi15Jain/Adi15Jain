Hi there, I’m Adi!
Building AI-first products and performant web apps. Passionate about LLMs, RAG systems, and crafting clean, scalable UIs.

Focus areas: AI/LLMs, Full‑stack (React/Next.js + FastAPI/Node), ML, DevTools.

Currently leveling up projects around AI assistants, document analysis, and developer productivity.

🔧 Tech Stack
Languages: Python, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript, C++

Frontend: React, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Three.js

Backend: FastAPI, Flask, Node.js, Express.js

Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB

ML/AI: scikit‑learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Hugging Face Transformers, LangChain, RAG

Tools: Git/GitHub, Vercel, Render, GitHub Actions, Postman, VS Code

🚀 Featured Projects
Exsyt — LLM‑powered tool to generate professional question papers from JSON, focused on clean frontend architecture and organized code structure.
Tech: React, TypeScript, Node/Express, MongoDB, LLM integration. [projects.exyst]

Sentysis — Twitter sentiment analysis with NLP + deep learning, including preprocessing, classification, and trend visualization.

📈 What I’m working on
Building reliable RAG pipelines and evaluation loops for retrieval quality.

Improving developer UX in AI chat tools (context management, tool use, and clean UIs).

Exploring alternatives to Mongoose for simpler backend data layers when appropriate.

🧪 Highlights
Secure, efficient APIs for course data using Express.js + MongoDB.

Strong TypeScript focus with attention to type safety and ergonomics.

Firebase experience for auth and user management.

🛠️ Setup & Deploy
